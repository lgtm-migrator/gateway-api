		"description": "Development and evaluation of rapid data-enabled access to routine clinical information to enhance early recruitment to the national clinical platform trial of COVID-19 community treatments. \n\nThe Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older people (PRINCIPLE) was established in March 2020 as an Urgent Public Health, UK-wide National Priority Platform that aims to evaluate the effects of repurposed drugs for people in the community with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at high risk of complications. The study currently aims to evaluate whether repurposed medicines speed recovery and reduce the need for hospitalisation and reduce deaths in people with suspected or proven COVID-19. The trial design allows trial arms to be stopped for proven effectiveness, futility or safety reasons, and for arms to be replaced or added. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for rapidly designing, initiating, and delivering therapeutic clinical trials. PRINCIPLE is the UK national platform investigating repurposed therapies for COVID-19 treatment of older people in the community at high risk of complications. Standard methods of patient recruitment were failing to meet the required pace and scale of enrolment.\n\nThe project focused on the development and appraisal of a near real-time, data-driven, ethical approach for enhancing recruitment in community care by contacting people with a recent COVID-19 positive test result from the central NHS Test and Trace service within 24-48 hours of their test result.",
		"resultsInsights": "Prior to establishing the data service, PRINCIPLE registered on average 87 participants per week. This increased by up to 87 additional people registered per week from the test data, contributing to an increase from 1,013 recruits to PRINCIPLE at the start of October 2020 to 2,802 recruits by 20th December 2020. By 12 February 2021, 4182 participants had been recruited.\n\nWhile procedural caveats were identified by the public consultation, out of 2,639 people contacted by PRINCIPLE following a positive test result, no one raised a concern about being approached.\n\nThis project developed a novel approach to using near-real time NHS operational data to recruit community-based patients within a few days of presentation with acute illness.\n\nThis approach increased recruitment, and reduced time between positive test and randomisation, allowing more rapid evaluation of treatments and increased safety for participants. End-to-end public and patient involvement in the design of the approach provided evidence to inform information governance decisions.\n\nLatest Preprint: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.21249724v1.full](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.21249724v1.full)",

		"description": "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), i.e. the monitoring of public health using samples collected from sewerage systems, offers the unique opportunity to make healthcare data widely available without compromising the privacy of individuals: by their very nature, sewerage systems aggregate the signal from thousands of people, diminishing the ability to identify any one individual. In addition to ongoing work modelling the relationship between case numbers and wastewater data, this project will deliver five additional benefits:\n* provide data on COVID-19 related hospital admissions and symptoms as a complementary signal to refine WBE modelling with higher spatiotemporal resolution than is currently available.\n* develop standards for exchanging WBE data that support automatic validation, increasing our confidence in the data.\nprovide consistent methods to aggregate healthcare data to catchment areas across England, Scotland, and Wales.\n* develop sound, privacy-preserving aggregation methods for sensitive data in the context of WBE that could help address future public health concerns, e.g. influenza outbreaks or illicit drug consumption.\n* subject to privacy due diligence, generate data products that can be shared publicly, aligning with the government’s open data strategy and allowing a broader audience to participate in WBE.\n",
